Playlik lets you create and share playlists with your friends.

There's a basic UI for creating and loading playlists and an accompanying JS library. The UI hooks into Playdar for content resolution.

Track search autocomplete, persistence and sharing are TODO :)

Also needs pretty UI and a snazzy logo.
